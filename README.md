Project: Dog Breed Identification 

This project aims to identify a dog's breed based on an unknown DNA sequence. The process involves:

1. Comparing the unknown sequence (mystery.fa) against a database of known dog breed sequences (dog_breeds.fa)

2. Calculating the probability (p-value) of the closest match

3. Constructing a phylogenetic tree to visualise evolutionary relationships

The project is organised ias such: 

Dog_breed_project
Data -> contains dog_breeds.fa (list of sequences) and mystery.fa (unknown sequence)
Code -> contains the Python script 
Results -> contains the output 
Tests -> contains the tests for the script
Venv -> is the virtual envirment
Requirements.txt -> contains the dependciies needed to run this project 

Arguments:

- mystery.fa: file containing the unknown sequence 
- dog_breeds.fa: file containing the known dog breed DNA sequences 


Example Output: 

- Closest match: 
- P-value: 
- Phylogenetic tree
